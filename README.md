# Food-Ordering-Page
I've created that Food-Ordering-Page as practice that came from Udemy lectures about react. In this project I am practicing basic React, fetching data from a mocking database that was created with Node.js. The CSS,the styling overall and the back isn't written by me,because that information comes with the lecture itself. The front-end code is written by me with the help of the lectures.

Hooks that are being practiced: useState, useEffect, useCallback, useReducer
Async fetching function and fetching data without a async function
Context aswell.
